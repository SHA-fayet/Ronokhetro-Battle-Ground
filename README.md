# Ronokhetro-Battle_Ground


Project Name: Ronokhetro (রণক্ষেত্র )
Core Features:
Arena Skirmish: The primary game mode. You control your tank in a walled arena against a set number of enemy tanks. The goal is to be the last tank standing.
Wave Survival: An intense mode where you face endless, increasingly difficult waves of enemy tanks. The goal is to survive as long as possible and achieve a high score.
Dynamic Arena: The battlefield contains destructible obstacles (cuboid barriers). These can be used for cover but will be destroyed after taking enough damage.
Power-Up Drops: Special items that randomly spawn on the map, providing temporary advantages when collected.
Enemy Variants: The game will feature at least two types of enemy AI tanks:
Scouts: Smaller, faster tanks with weaker armor.
Juggernauts: Larger, slower tanks with heavy armor and stronger cannons.
Cheat Modes: Special functions the player can toggle to gain an unfair advantage, perfect for testing and fun.

Power-Up Drops Detailed:
Armor Repair: A green-glowing cube that instantly restores 25% of your tank's armor (health).
Rapid Fire: A yellow-glowing cylinder that doubles your tank's firing speed for 10 seconds.
Ammo Crate: A standard cube that instantly refills your shell ammunition to the maximum.
Engine Boost: A blue-glowing sphere that increases your tank's movement and rotation speed by 50% for 10 seconds.

Cheat Modes Detailed:
Infinite Shells: Your ammunition count never decreases, allowing for endless firing.
EMP Blast: Press a key to emit an energy pulse that freezes all enemy tanks in place for 3 seconds.
Auto-Turret Lock: Your tank's turret will automatically lock onto the nearest enemy and fire whenever possible. You still have full control over your tank's movement.
