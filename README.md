‚ú® Key Features
Endless Wave System: Face off against progressively harder waves of enemy scout and juggernaut tanks. The battle only ends when you do!

Epic Boss Battles: Every third wave, a powerful Boss Tank appears! This massive enemy features higher health and a devastating three-shot spread attack that will test your skills.

Tank Upgrade System: Don't just survive‚Äîevolve! Use the score you earn from destroying enemies to purchase permanent upgrades for your tank in real-time:

Armor (U): Increase your maximum health to withstand more punishment.

Cannon (I): Boost your fire rate to overwhelm your foes.

Speed (O): Enhance your movement and rotation speed to outmaneuver the enemy.

Environmental Hazards: The arena is not always a safe place! Watch out for dangerous lava pits that will rapidly drain your health if you drive through them.

Dynamic Day/Night Cycle & Weather: The battle rages on through a full day/night cycle that affects the ambient lighting. During the darkest parts of the night, rain will fall, adding to the atmosphere.
